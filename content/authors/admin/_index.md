I'm Kameron, a master's student studying computer science at the University of Southern California. I am part of the <a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/">USC Theory Group</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/">Vatsal Sharan</a>. I'm interested in responsible machine learning from the lens of fairness, robustness, and privacy. I am also fond of cryptography, which I studied throughout my research internship at <a href="https://privacyresearch.io/">Privacy Research LLC</a>.

While completing my bachelor's, I worked as an autopilot sensor intern at <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla, Inc.</a>, applied machine learning to healthcare at <a href="hhttps://kuhn.usc.edu//">CSI-Cancer</a>, and conducted location research at the <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/">USC Information Laboratory</a>. 

I am applying to PhD programs in computer science during Fall 2023. Please reach out if there's anything you'd like to discuss!
